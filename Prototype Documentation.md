### Week 0 - 2
* To start with I did some research on my limb mechanic, and what I found was a dismemberment system I could modify to make detachable limbs. My main inspiration for this game is It takes Two (It Takes Two on Steam. https://store.steampowered.com/app/1426210/It_Takes_Two/. Accessed 5 Dec. 2024.) I liked the idea of a small toy character in a big ovesized world. In this game the characters use many different objects and I thought instead of objects the player would have attachments for its limbs to create unique weapons and a unique character design. For instance the character could have

* Then I created a simple character in Maya for my character model, I was aiming for a robot look with destinctive limbs, however, my 3D modeling is quite limited so I went for a simple look instead.

* after that research I started to attempt to do the dismemberment system.

After using this code I realised it broke my project so I will be putting that aside and focus on getting the main mechanic working

* I then followed this tutorial that showed me the basics of rigging bipedal model characters using the skeletal rig editor, this will allow me to add physics amd animations to the character.

### Week 3 - 4
* I added some animations to my character from Mixamo.

* when I try to open or move these files it breaks my game, I cannot even delete them.

* I keep having issues with this modular system so I am going to put it on the back burner for now to focus on other things.
* My github saves seem to be corrupted I cant go back any amount of saves as it will just crash. At this point I may scrap the modular character and focus on making a quirky platformer instead.
* After closer inspection my third person character was glitched too.

* I fixed my gun so it only shoots when picked up, This will stop cheating as the player would be able to place the gun in the arena and just shoot.

### Play Testing

To make sure how good my game is to play I had 9 play testers try my game. I Will showcase a few videos of these play testers.

> ## Finished prototype

This is the final version of my prototype, there are still a few bugs such as the AI health not displaying correctly, knife animations not working, the player aim offset being very janky, and the game breaking after wave (30), As well as a glitch with the physics where if the gun is facing the floor there is a chance the player can be launched across the map. However I have added the foundation of my project and I will be able to use the concept of this game in the future and possibly be able to have another try at the modular character syetem.

### Final Thoughts

This project was not what I expected to have at the end of my project as I was hoping for more. This mistake was due to constant craashes of the project and Github desktop not accepting my project. But some of it was due to poor time managemnt on my part. I was unable to balance my essay, prototype, and final group project meetings efficently and it has impacted my workflow. My nect major goal is to look at some new ways I can efficently manage my time to ensure I have the best project I could possibly make.

Besides that however, I am pleased I managed to get the spawn system mainly working and fixed my gun, unfortunetly I will not be making this prototype a full fledged game at the moment due ; However, I find the premise interesting and may start full development in my own time.
