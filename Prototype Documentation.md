After using this code I relised it broke my project so I will be putting that aside and focus on getting the main mechanic working

I keep having issues with this modular system so I am going to put it on the back burner for now to focus on other things.
> My github saves seem to be corrupted I cant go back any amount of saves as it will just crash. At this point I may scrap the modular character and focus on making a quirky platformer instead.
> After closer inspection my third person character was glitched too.

>My next plan is to make it so the spine and/or the arm folow the camera to create a mild ragdoll effect

>There seems to be an issue with the guns aiming as sometimes it is not that accurate.

> I managed to make a anim montage for the aiming so that should assist in making it more accurate

Doesnt work

Thought it might be an issue with the event begin play event so i changed it to activate when 'E' was pressed, half the time the drop key 'G' is unresponsive, and it only works once otherwise the gun is stuck in the hand and on the floor.
