I then created a simple model of the main character, and I tried to make it resemble a robot.

After using this code I relised it broke my project so I will be putting that aside and focus on getting the main mechanic working

I then followed this tutorial that showed me the basics of rigging bipedal model characters using the skeletal rig editor, this will alow me to add physocs amd amimations to the character.

### Week 3 - 4

I keep having issues with this modular system so I am going to put it on the back burner for now to focus on other things.
> My github saves seem to be corrupted I cant go back any amount of saves as it will just crash. At this point I may scrap the modular character and focus on making a quirky platformer instead.
> After closer inspection my third person character was glitched too.

> I got the gun to shoot, Now I just need to make it deal damage

> I managed to make a anim montage for the aiming so that should assist in making it more accurate

Doesnt work

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de7b60a6-4bfc-4895-bac3-95d4669c63dc

Thought it might be an issue with the event begin play event so i changed it to activate when 'E' was pressed, half the time the drop key 'G' is unresponsive, and it only works once otherwise the gun is stuck in the hand and on the floor.

I managed to fix the issue

The enemies health widget was bugged so I hid it in the game.
I got the gun to be able to aim. I fixed the wave system but it will bug past wave (30)

> ## Finished prototype

This is the final version of my prototype, there are still a few bugs such as the ai health not displaying correctly, knife animations not working, the player aim offset being very janky, and the game breaking after wave 30. However I have layed the foundation of my projec and I will be able to add of this foundation in the future and possibly be able to have another try at the modular character syetem.

### Final Thoughts

This project was not what I expected to have at the end of my project as I was hoping for more. This mistake was due to constant craashes of the project and Github desktop not accepting my project. But some of it was due to poor time managemnt on my part. I was unable to balance my essay, prototype, and final group project meetings efficently and it has impacted my workflow. My nect major goal is to look at some new ways I can efficently manage my time to ensure I have the best project I could possibly make.

Besides that however, I am pleased I managed to get the spawn system mainly working and fixed my gun, unfortunetly I will not be making this prototype a full fledged game at the moment; However, I find the premise interesting and may start full development in my own time.
